# 🧼 SoapLife: The Rub Counter

> *How many rubs can a bar of soap survive before it vanishes?*  
> A quirky, experimental, and slightly pointless project to measure just that.

## 🧠 Project Description

SoapLife is a lighthearted exploration into the life expectancy of a bar of soap measured in *rubs*. With experimental trials, and basic physics modeling, this project aims to estimate how many rubs it takes before a soap bar dissolves completely. Although the concept sounds absurd, it involves engineering design, real-world data collection, and practical coding—making it a perfect example of a “useless but fun” project.

## The Problem

Despite the widespread use of soap in daily life, no metric exists to quantify how many rubs a soap bar can endure before becoming unusable. Users often throw away soap too early or end up with frustrating soap slivers that are hard to use. Manufacturers also lack a consumer-validated metric to label their soaps with something more meaningful than just “weight in grams.”

## 👨‍🔬 Solution

We are creating a website to showcase SoapLife and its features:
1. 🎥 A live counter that tracks the number of rubs a soap undergoes.
2. 📚 A detailed write-up of the theoretical model behind soap life.
3. 💡 Fun facts about soap chemistry and friction.
4. 🌐 Leaderboard of longest-lasting soaps (by rubs).
5. 📦 Graveyard showing ancestors.
